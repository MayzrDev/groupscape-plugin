/**
 * Tracks "combo" encounters - Barrows' six brothers, the three Moons of Peril moons - where each
 * sub-boss despawns independently but the group only wants one combined activity-feed/toast/
 * webhook entry naming whichever ones actually died, emitted the moment the shared reward chest
 * (Barrows chest / Lunar Chest) is looted. Individual sub-boss kills still ship as their own
 * ordinary {@link KillLootDeathEvents#onKill} events untouched by this class - so per-NPC kill
 * count/stats tracking keeps working - they're just excluded from the server's notable-npc list
 * so they never surface on their own; this class only adds the extra combined entry on top.
 *
 * Each despawn of a tracked sub-boss ({@link #onSubBossDespawned}) appends its short display label
 * to a per-combo pending list, in kill order. {@link #onComboChestLoot} is called once the
 * matching chest's {@code LootReceived} arrives; it flushes that list into one synthesized
 * {@link KillLootDeathEvents#onComboKill} call carrying every label collected so far, then clears
 * it. A pending list idle for longer than {@link #STALE_MILLIS} (no sub-boss despawn and no chest
 * loot) is dropped rather than carried into a later, unrelated attempt - see
 * {@link #dropIfStale}. Must only be touched from the client thread.
